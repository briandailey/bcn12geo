## Setup
Create a virtual environment and install the requirements.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You will need PostgreSQL and PostGIS already installed with the user bcn, dbname bcn and password foobar.

You may need to install GDAL, which is an adventure in itself and is too detailed to go into here.

    # set up the django tables
    python manage.py syncdb

Load up the blockgroup and crimes database (there is a SQL dump in ./sql/).

### Start up the tile server

    alias tileserver='export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:`cd ..` && export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=bcn12.settings && tilestache-server.py -c tileserver/tilestache.cfg'
